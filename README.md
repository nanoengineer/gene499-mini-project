The delicate nature of porcelain is associated with both fragility and preciousness; consequently, the teacup is understood on a social and cultural level to be an object of value. storm in a teacup is comprised of stacked teacups and saucers that seem as though they could collapse at any moment. In combining a seemingly unstable structure with perceived precious objects, this interactive piece aims to evoke a physical or emotional response from the viewer. In addition to their precarious form, the teacups rattle as the viewer approaches the structure, further heightening an already anxious and suspenseful situation.

Despite the teacup having social and cultural associations, any object is only as significant as the value that is attributed to them by an individual or group. The title, storm in a teacup, derives from the idiom that describes a situation in which a person or group overreacts to something that is not in reality important. With an ever increasing materialistic attitude, this work comments on excessive feelings of distress experienced by our society when faced with the loss of valuable yet dispensable objects.
